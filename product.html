	<p>The <b>Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</b> is an 8-bit home video game console developed and manufactured by Nintendo. It is a remodeled export version of the company's <b>Family Computer(FC)</b> platform in Japan, commonly known as the <b>Famicom</b>, which was launched on July 15, 1983. The NES was launched in the test markets of New York City and Los Angeles in 1985, with a full launch in the rest of North America and parts of Europe in 1986, followed by Australia and other European countries in 1987. Brazil saw only unlicensed clones until the official local release in 1993. In South Korea, it was packaged as the <b>Hyundai Comboy</b> and distributed by Hyundai Electronics which is now SK Hynix; the Comboy was released in 1989.</p>

	<p>The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the North American video game crash of 1983.With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform.It had been preceded by Nintendo's first home video game console, the Color TV-Game, and was succeeded by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES).</p><hr class="style-four">

	<p>The <b>Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES)</b>, also known as the <b>Super NES</b> or <b>Super Nintendo</b>,is a 16-bit home video game console developed by Nintendo that was released in 1990 in Japan and South Korea, 1991 in North America, 1992 in Europe and Australasia (Oceania), and 1993 in South America. In Japan, the system is called the <b>Super Famicom (SFC)</b>.In South Korea, it is known as the <b>Super Comboy</b> and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. The system was released in Brazil on August 30, 1993, by Playtronic. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another.</p>

	<p>The SNES is Nintendo's second programmable home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other systems at the time. The system was designed to accommodate the ongoing development of a variety of enhancement chips integrated in game cartridges to be competitive into the next generation.</p>

	<p>The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era after launching relatively late and facing intense competition from Sega's Genesis console in North America and Europe. Overlapping the NES's 61.9 million unit sales, the SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era, with 49.1 million units sold worldwide by the time it was discontinued in 2003. It continues to be popular among collectors and retro gamers, with new homebrew games and Nintendo's emulated rereleases, such as on the Virtual Console and the Super NES Classic Edition.</p><hr class="style-four">

	<p>The <b>Nintendo 64</b> (N64 for short, model number: <b>NUS</b>), stylized as <b>NINTENDO64</b>, is a home video game console developed and marketed by Nintendo. Named for its 64-bit central processing unit, it was released in June 1996 in Japan, September 1996 in North America and Brazil, March 1997 in Europe and Australia, and September 1997 in France. It was the last major home console to use the cartridge as its primary storage format until the Nintendo Switch in 2017. The Nintendo 64 was discontinued in mid-2002 following the launch of its successor, the GameCube, in 2001.</p>

	<p>Codenamed "Project Reality", the Nintendo 64 design was mostly complete by mid-1995, but its launch was delayed until 1996, when Time named it Machine of the Year. It was launched with three games: Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64 (worldwide) and Saikyō Habu Shōgi (exclusive to Japan). As part of the fifth generation of gaming, the system competed primarily with the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The suggested retail price at its United States launch was US$199.99, and 32.93 million units were sold worldwide. In 2015, IGN named it the ninth-greatest video game console of all time.</p><hr class="style-four">

	<p>The <b>Nintendo GameCube</b> (commonly abbreviated as <b>GameCube</b>, model number: <b>DOL</b>) is a home video game console released by Nintendo in Japan and North America in 2001 and Europe and Australia in 2002. The sixth-generation console is the successor to the Nintendo 64. It competed with Sony's PlayStation 2, Microsoft's Xbox and Sega's Dreamcast.</p>

	<p>The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage medium. The discs are in the miniDVD format and the system was not designed to play full-sized DVDs or audio CDs, unlike its competitors, and focused on gaming instead. The console supports online gaming for a small number of games via a GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link cable, which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller.</p>

	<p>The GameCube uses composite video cables to display games on the television; however, there are differences in the two GameCube models. The models produced before May 2004 also had the ability to use digital component AV cables and progressive scan and a second serial port. The nameplate on the top of the console with the words "Nintendo GameCube" could be removed. This model was known as DOL-001. All those features were removed in GameCube consoles produced between 2004-2007; the later model was known as DOL-101. The newer model had firmware that disabled Action Replay cheats and cheat codes and the disc-reading laser was improved in many ways, though it did not last as long. The newer model came with a 48-watt AC adapter to power the console, while the original was 46 watts.</p>

	<p>Reception of the GameCube at the time was generally positive. The console was praised for its controller, extensive software library and high-quality games, but was criticized for its exterior design and lack of features. Nintendo sold 21.74 million GameCube units worldwide before the console was discontinued in 2007.</p><br>
